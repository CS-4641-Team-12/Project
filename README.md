## Introduction

Our project focuses on video games and predicting the amount of success that they have. We used the factors of genre, year of release, platform, and publisher in order to predict how good a game would be. We defined how good a game is as the scores that are given by both the users as well as critics as scraped from the website, Metacritic.

## Importance

Gaming has already become a massive industry that not only competes with how much other industries such as movies and music, but even have more money put into the industry. Furthermore, if current trends continue as projected, they will grow even more as can be seen in the figure below.

Although we can clearly see that gaming is a growing industry from the graph that is seen above, there are also other indicators that gaming will be an industry that continues to grow: in particualar, who plays games.

As can be seen from the above, it is very clear that gamers very much skew towards a younger audience. As with any industry, it is highly likely that people who are young and gaming, will continue to game and continue to contribute to the growth of the industry.
